# Lines
 Simple screensaver that I wrote in Pascal for fun almost 3 years ago.
 It has moving colorful lines! What else do you need? 
 
 As you can see,
 source code comes with a compiled 64-bit executable (lines.scr) for
 Windows.
 
## Controls
 Click the left mouse button to interrupt the screensaver.

## Building
 Compile it using Lazarus v1.8.2 or higher.
